<h2>Notehax Has Been Patched!!</h2>
Sadly, the newest Homebrew exploit for Nintendo 3ds's that are on version 11.5
has been patched. The hacking community and Homebrewers alike are upset by the 
11.6 update patch and are hoping for a newer exploit, so far no news has been 
released on new exploits, and hopefully there will be one for version 11.6 .

<h2>RpwNG Codes are looking vain in existance</h2>
Ever since one of the most known exploits, RPGhax (or RpwNG) was released codes
have gone and expired very quickly and now are hardly able to be found anymore.
In the guide to installing RPGhax, mrnbayoh, a well known 3ds exploit maker 
stated that you could find codes searching up #GetRpwNG on Twitter. This worked
very well in it's first few days of existence but now are very hard to find.
Hopefully mrnbayoh releases new codes for everybody for those who still want to Homebrew.
